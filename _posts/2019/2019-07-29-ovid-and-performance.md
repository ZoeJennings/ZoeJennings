Ovid's _Metamorphoses_ is an epic poem that is tailor-made for performance. We already know from the presence of Ovidian material in Shakespeare's plays and John Weaver's eighteenth-century ballets that the poem holds rich potential for dramatic and danced performance in the modern period. Such early dramatists' appreciation of the performability of Ovid, while never disappearing and indeed experiencing a small but sustained renewal in the early twentieth century, is now re-entering public consciousness on an unprecedented scale. The _Metamorphoses_, and episodes from it, are now some of the most popular classical material for dramatic adaptation in all its forms: spoken drama, oral or vocal performance, and dance - and everything in between.

Ovid knew full well that his poem had the potential to become akin to a dramatic script. Not only is the Metamorphoses replete with references and re-appropriations of ancient drama (tragedy, comedy, and most importantly mime and pantomime, an extremely popular form of dance in imperial Rome), but the poem himself later asserts that his poetry is being 'danced' and suggests it is entering the pantomime repertoire in his lifetime.
